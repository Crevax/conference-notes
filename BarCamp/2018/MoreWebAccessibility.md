# Web Accessibility

By Sam Bleckley

## Why

Because everyone should be able to use the web

## Standards

Rely on written standards (ARIA) instead of personal experience. Using a screen reader will always be a different experience for someone with sight than a blind person.

## Personal Tips from Sam

Don't use hover, use focus - hover movements can inititate focus.

Build accessibility from the ground up; styling can come later (function over form);
