Component-Based Javascript using Flight.js
Joel Byler

What is Flight.js
  - Event-driven web framework from Twitter

Component
  - JS object that references a DOM node
  - Can manipulate the DOM within its node
  - Listen to or trigger an event on the node
  - Completely decoupled from each other

Attribute
  - Use by components and mixins
  - Can be overridden

Initializer
  - Attaches component to DOM node
    - Set up listeners

Behavior
  - Functions within the component

Initialing a component
  - jQuery style selector
  - Each matching DOM element will have an instance of the component

Mixins
  - All reuse of component pieces
  - Can be composed of other mixins

Advice
  - A predefined mixin
    - Defines before, after, and around functions

Testings
  - Can use Jasmine
    - Has its own extension
  - Mocha extension

Misc notes
  - Can handle event bubbling
