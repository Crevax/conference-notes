Overview
  - Practical uses of automation
  - Using free tools
  - Not a comparison of deployment solutions
  - Not a product advertisement
  - Not a tutorial on writing code

Big Idea
  A developer who manually builds and deploys code is like a NASCAR driver who insists on changing their own tires

Introducing Jenkins
  - An open source automation system that can handle building, testing, and deploying software

Automation #1
  Automate your builds based upon a specified event such as a check-in to source control

Automation #2
  Rehydrate build files using package managers

Automation #3
  Automatically deploy built software to development, staging, and production servers

Automation #4
  Transform the build software based upon the needs of the deployment server

#5
  Run tests automatically and break the build on test failure

#6
  Create deployment notes that pull from commit messages and are formaatted in a readable manner

#7
  Email interested parties based upon the success or failure of a build

#8
  Alert customers and others via social media when an update happens
  - If This Then That (IFTTT) plugin

#9
  Call or text interested parties on build success or failure
  - Twilio plugin

Bonus automations
  - Update the software version with a build number
  - Mark the calendar with the build version
  - Change the color of the lights
  - Update help tickets
  - Spin up test servers
