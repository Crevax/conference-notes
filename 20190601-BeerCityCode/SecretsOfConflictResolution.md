### What is Conflict Resolution

Way for two or more parties to find a peaceful solution to a disagreement

## Approaches to Conflict Resolution

### Collaborating

a.k.a. problem solving, confronting, integrating, win-win style

Used when consensus is important: a collaborative environment, or when the interest of multiple stakeholders needs to be addressed. Effective when a high level of trust is present. Important for maintaining long-term relationships.

#### Advantages

Actually solves the problem. Everyone wins. Reinforces mutual trust and respect. Builds a foundationg for effective collaboration in the future.

#### Disadvantages

It can take a lot of time and effort to reach a resolution, which may not be available.

### Compromising

a.k.a. give and take, reconciling

Conflicting parties have to bargain, so all needs may not be met. Useful when the issue isn't as important. Useful as a first step. But the resolution might only be temporary, as one or more parties might not be fully satisfied in the long term.

### Smoothing

a.k.a. accommodating, obliging

Similar to a compromise, but one side is more accepting of giving things up. Agreements are emphasized and disagreements are downplayed. Useful to provide temporary relief or buy time. Sometimes an expedient resolution is necessary to avoid other risks.

Be careful that it doesn't lead to being taken advantage of, or results in the loss of support from others.

### Forcing

a.k.a directing, competing, controlling, dominating

Flip side of smoothing. The assertivenes of one side dictates the outcome and addresses it head-on. Might be necessary to avoid being perceived as a doormat, but it also risks losing relationships. Sometimes other parties respond in a similar manner, leading to more conflicts. Strength/advatanges of the other side(s) may be missed.

### Withdrawl

a.k.a avoidance

Resolution is pushed back to a later time. Could be seen as an extreme form of smoothing, but an actual resolution needs to occur at some time. Useful when it's not worth the time/effort, something is currently more important, or a sound judgement cannot be made at the time. Need to be careful that withdrawing isn't seen as agreement with the other part(y|ies).
